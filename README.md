**Front-End Web Developer** with 3 years of experience, +2 years in **Angular**(Typescript/Javascript) and +1 year in **PHP**. 

My main motivation is to develop creative and innovative digital solutions, combining my 2 passions: **design** and **programming**.

I have dedicated my time to work on both my personal and professional development; researching/acquiring new technical knowledge, and perfecting my productivity, leadership, and teamwork skills.

In the years that I have been working as a Web Developer, I have developed an application that helps companies to focus and align the execution of their strategic plan, and strengthen the achievement of their objectives.
